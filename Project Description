#C.A.S.S
##Author: James Park

C.A.S.S, an acronym short for Computer Automated Software Servant, is a natural language processing project I am working on that would be able to take directions from the user and do cool stuff and shit.

Project Goal:
I am working on C.A.S.S to learn NLP from an engineering standpoint while also discovering how modern day software such as Alexa, Siri, and Cortana operate. I also want to feel like Tony Stark designing J.A.R.V.I.S   :)
